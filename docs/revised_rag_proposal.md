# üì¨ Proposal: Full Stack (LLM, Integrations, SaaS) ‚Äì Intelligent Knowledge Management Platform

Hello,

I'm excited about your vision to build an AI-powered knowledge platform that helps teams unify, process, and retrieve their internal knowledge across fragmented tools. Below is a deep technical proposal detailing how I would approach designing and building your MVP.

---

## ‚úÖ How I Understand the Challenge

You are building a B2B SaaS platform to:

1. **Ingest and intelligently process unstructured content** (calls, chats, documents).
2. **Apply LLM-powered workflows** to summarize, classify, and semantically index content.
3. **Integrate with tools** like Notion, Gmail, Slack, LMS to unify knowledge sources.
4. **Automate internal knowledge discovery and retrieval** via a performant API and admin UI.
5. **Deliver a scalable, decoupled architecture** ready to grow with usage and data volume.

## üß± System Architecture (Subsystems Overview)

### üéØ Key Design Principles

- **Decoupling** via message-based communication (Kafka/Redis/RabbitMQ).
- **Async pipelines** for ingestion, processing, and storage.
- **LLM modularity** via LangChain and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
- **UI & API separation** for clean scalability and team collaboration.
- **Stateless microservices** with retriable, observable jobs.

## üõ† Subsystem Breakdown

### 1. **Ingestion Layer**

Connects to external tools via API/webhook (Slack, Notion, Gmail, LMS). Normalizes and publishes ingestion events.

### 2. **Message Queue/Event Bus**

Connects all services in a decoupled fashion using Kafka or Redis Streams. Ensures fault tolerance and retry support.

### 3. **Preprocessing Service**

Normalizes content:

- Text cleaning, OCR (Tesseract/Vision API)
- Chunking for embedding
- Language detection

### 4. **LLM Pipeline (with RAG)**

Orchestrates LLM tasks:

- **Summarization**: Document-level summaries
- **Classification**: Topic/urgency
- **RAG**:
  - Embed user query ‚Üí search vector DB ‚Üí inject results into prompt ‚Üí generate final output

```mermaid
graph TD
  A[User Query] --> B[Embed Query]
  B --> C[Vector DB Search]
  C --> D[Top-k Documents]
  D --> E[Inject into Prompt Template]
  E --> F[LLM Generates Final Output]
```

### 5. **Storage Layer**

- **Postgres** stores metadata (summary, source, classification)
- **Vector DB (Qdrant)** stores semantic embeddings for search

### 6. **API Layer**

Built with FastAPI:

- `/search` (RAG)
- `/document/{id}`
- `/status`
- `/connect`

### 7. **Admin Dashboard**

Built with React + Tailwind:

- Connect integrations
- View/search documents
- Monitor pipeline jobs
- Retry failed processes

## üìã Clarification Questions

1. Who will use the Admin Dashboard ‚Äî internal team or customer-facing?
2. What productivity tools must be supported in MVP (Slack, Notion, Gmail)?
3. Do you need multi-tenancy (workspace/user isolation)?
4. Preferred cloud provider for hosting? (e.g. Railway, AWS)
5. Do you prioritize speed to MVP or future scalability in first sprints?
